 The plot for the implementation using fread is much faster than the implemntation using read, This is since read directly utilzies a buffer while fread only refills the buffer when it is needed. Read makes system calls every iteration while fread only calls read and thus a system call when it has to to read more data from the file. Essentially fread calls the kernel much less often. But read can be faster than fread with the correct paramters since it has less overhead than fread.
